Kaytee's feedback
===

* split off docs into two sections
| However, I feel a bit of “gumminess” in getting to the “write good docs” section
* I find it easiest to follow an organization that clearly builds from single functions to modules to executable scripts or some similar build-up. 
* add more information about going from jupyter notebooks to a different kind of pipeline
* 
Add more code challenges
Level 1 challenge = replace print with assert. 
Level 2 challenge = write a test.py file for one of your smaller modules.

docs.html

-> Very low-level documentation. Installation instructions, usage examples, development environment setup.
> % bcs needed to get you started (new user happy path)

- Very high-level documentation. Design documents, data models and system diagrams, links to papers, etc.
> % bcs needed to know the why? of the codebase --- for the how? and what? you read the source code

Cut doctests
~~Fix CSS bug on resizing~~
 ~~-> Show hamburger menu conditionally.~~

Some questions you might consider:

1. Was the advice consistent with what you consider best practices? If not, how so?
1. Were some critical subjects not covered by this book?
1. Was the narrative cohesive? 
1. Were some subjects treated too superficially? Were some subjects treated with too much detail? How was the pacing overall?
1. Was the level appropriate for the target audience (2nd and 3rd year grad students focused on computational subjects)? If not, how so?
1. Did you feel that illustrations were appropriate? Where do you feel more illustrations would be helpful to the narrative?
1. Did you feel like the questions were appropriate? Would more comprehension questions help students learn?
