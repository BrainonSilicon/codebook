# Testing

## Testing to maintain your sanity

When you run an experiment and the results of the analysis don't make sense, you will go through a process of eliminating one potential cause after the other. You will investigate several hypotheses, including:

* the data is bad
* you're loading the data incorrectly
* your model is incorrectly implemented
* your model is inappropriate for the data
* the statistical test you used is inappropriate for the data distribution

Testing can help you maintain your sanity by decreasing the surface of things that might be wrong with your experiment. Good code yells loudly when something goes wrong. Imagine that you had an experimental setup that alerted you when you had a ground loop, or that would sound off when you use the wrong reagent, or that would text you when it's about to overheat - how many hours or days would you save?
