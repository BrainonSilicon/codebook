# Attitude

When I talk to students about writing poor code, a lot of them describe feelings like:

* guilt
* shame
* cringe
* frustration


```{tip}
If you feel overwhelmed by a bug in your code, read this lovely zine from [Julia Evans](https://wizardzines.com/comics/attitude-matters/)
```

You might have experienced talking about computer stuff to somebody more experienced and came out discouraged. Perhaps they were dismissive, or snooty, or just kind of a jerk. It's an unfortunate tendency in our profession, and I want to break that cycle, because I think it makes it hard to become proficient at coding.

```{important}
This is a safe space. You're in a learning environment. The advice I give here is non-binding and non-sanctimonious.

## Social rules

It seems a little silly to write about social rules in a book, but I'd like you to spread the joy of this book to others. In doing so perpetuate the inclusive learning environment that I've tried to create here. I like the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)'s social rules:

* *No feigning surprise*. Don't act like you're surprised when someone says they never heard of tool X, language Y or method Z.
* *No well actuallys*. Don't correct someone with a sentence that starts *well actually*, it's pedantic and annoying.
* *No backseat driving*. Don't lob advice from across the room if you don't intend on actually getting deeply involved. Also, no twitter fights.
* *No subtle -isms*. Don't say things that are sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc.  Don't say things like "it's so easy my mother could do it!" - that's subtly sexist in a way that just discourages wxmen people from participating.
