# Your learning journey

Learning to code is a lifelong journey. The upper ceiling on programming skills is very high. Much like cooking, coding can be done on a purely utilitarian basis, or it can elevated to high art. [Even professional programmers with decades of experience go on months-long retreats to acquire new skills](https://www.recurse.com/about). *A good frame* for getting better at coding is to think of it as a *craft*. Reading this book is a great way to refine your craft through targetted practice [^CalNewport].

[^CalNewport]: CS professor Cal Newport explores these themes in his book [So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://www.calnewport.com/books/so-good/).

Take a look at this roadmap and take stock of where you are now. Come back to this figure after you've read parts of this book - you'll be surprised how much you can learn in a few hours!

## Breaking the cycle of frustration

When I talk to students about writing code, a lot of them describe feelings like:

* guilt
* shame
* cringe
* frustration

```

Much of that frustration comes from a mismatch between what you want to accomplish (a lot) and what you have the ability to accomplish (not as much as you'd like). Programming instruction often emphasizes *exploration(), embracing errors as learning opportunities, and encouraging you to let your imagination run free. This theory of change implies that you will learn a lot by simply programming a lot every day. You might then feel guilty and inadequate when you're not as proficient as you want after several years of daily programming.

In fact, unstructured exploration is a very inefficient way to learn a complex skill like programming. It's like expecting a student to rediscover calculus by themselves after teaching them the rudiments of algebra! Research shows that *structured instruction* - like the one in this book - is far more effective at teaching programming skills [^Felienne]. You're taking the right step by reading this book!

## Our social contract

You might have experienced talking about computer stuff to somebody more experienced and came out discouraged. Perhaps they were dismissive, or snooty, or just kind of a jerk. It's an unfortunate tendency in our profession, and I want to break that cycle, because I think that this lack of *psychological safety* can make it hard to become proficient at coding.

```{important}
This is a safe space. You're in a learning environment. There will be no tests. The advice I give here is non-binding and non-sanctimonious. 
```

It's ok to write bad code when you're learning or you're in a hurry. You have deadlines! Just remember to come back to the bad code and tidy it up after. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. And remember, once you are empowered with this new knowledge, to be nice to beginners who are going through the same journey that you have.
