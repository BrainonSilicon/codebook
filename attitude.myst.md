# Your learning journey

Learning to code is a lifelong journey. The upper ceiling on programming skills is very high. Much like cooking, coding can be done on a purely utilitarian basis, or it can elevated to high art. [Even professional programmers with decades of experience go on months-long retreats to acquire new skills](https://www.recurse.com/about). A good frame for getting better at coding is thinking of it as a craft which you refine through targetted practice. Reading this book is a great way to refine your craft.

Some foundational skills you will learn here will give you a lot of bang for your buck. As you move forward in your learning journey, it's helpful to take stock of where you started from and how much you've learned. You can read just parts of this book to help you along your journey, or you can read the whole thing: it's all up to you.

## Breaking the cycle of frustration

When I talk to students about writing code, a lot of them describe feelings like:

* guilt
* shame
* cringe
* frustration


```{tip}
If you feel overwhelmed by a bug in your code, read this lovely zine from [Julia Evans](https://wizardzines.com/comics/attitude-matters/)
```

You might have experienced talking about computer stuff to somebody more experienced and came out discouraged. Perhaps they were dismissive, or snooty, or just kind of a jerk. It's an unfortunate tendency in our profession, and I want to break that cycle, because I think it makes it hard to become proficient at coding.

```{important}
This is a safe space. You're in a learning environment. There will be no tests. The advice I give here is non-binding and non-sanctimonious. 
```

It's ok to write bad code when you're learning or you're in a hurry. You have deadlines! Just remember to come back to the bad code and tidy it up after. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. 

## Social rules

It seems a little silly to write about social rules in a book, but I'd like you to spread the joy of this book to others. In doing so perpetuate the inclusive learning environment that I've tried to create here. I like the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)'s social rules:

* *No feigning surprise*. Don't act like you're surprised when someone says they never heard of tool X, language Y or method Z.
* *No well actuallys*. Don't correct someone with a sentence that starts *well actually*, it's pedantic and annoying.
* *No backseat driving*. Don't lob advice from across the room if you don't intend on actually getting deeply involved. Also, no twitter fights.
* *No subtle -isms*. Don't say things that are sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc.  Don't say things like "it's so easy my mother could do it!" - that's subtly sexist in a way that just discourages wxmen people from participating.
