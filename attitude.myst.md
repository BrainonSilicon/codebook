# Your learning journey

Learning to code is a lifelong journey. The upper ceiling on programming skills is very high. Much like cooking, coding can be done on a purely utilitarian basis, or it can elevated to high art. [Even professional programmers with decades of experience go on months-long retreats to acquire new skills](https://www.recurse.com/about). *A good frame* for getting better at coding is thinking of it as a craft which you refine through targetted practice. Reading this book is a great way to refine your craft.

Some foundational skills you will learn here will give you a lot of bang for your buck. As you move forward in your learning journey, it's helpful to take stock of where you started from and how much you've learned. You can read just parts of this book to help you along your journey, or you can read the whole thing: it's all up to you.

## Breaking the cycle of frustration

When I talk to students about writing code, a lot of them describe feelings like:

* guilt
* shame
* cringe
* frustration


```{tip}
If you feel overwhelmed by a bug in your code, read this lovely zine from [Julia Evans](https://wizardzines.com/comics/attitude-matters/)
```

Much of that frustration can come from a mismatch between what you want to accomplish (a lot) and what you have the ability to accomplish (not as much as you'd like). Programming instruction often encourages exploration, embracing errors as learning opportunities and encouraging let your imagination run free. This type of instruction can imply that you will learn a lot by simply programming a lot every day. You might then feel guilty when you're not as proficient as you want after several years.

In fact, unstructured exploration is a very inefficient way to get someone from novice to expert. It's like expecting you to rediscover calculus by introducing the concept of infitesimals! Research shows that *structured instruction* - like the one in this book - is far more effective at teaching programming skills [^Felienne]. You're taking the right step by reading this book!

## Our social contract

You might have experienced talking about computer stuff to somebody more experienced and came out discouraged. Perhaps they were dismissive, or snooty, or just kind of a jerk. It's an unfortunate tendency in our profession, and I want to break that cycle, because I think it makes it hard to become proficient at coding.

```{important}
This is a safe space. You're in a learning environment. There will be no tests. The advice I give here is non-binding and non-sanctimonious. 
```

It's ok to write bad code when you're learning or you're in a hurry. You have deadlines! Just remember to come back to the bad code and tidy it up after. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. And remember, once you are empowered with this new knowledge, to be nice to beginners.
